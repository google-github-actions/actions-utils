# Releasing

## Updating Actions

To update the actions repositories you will need to update each repository with the lastest `actions-utils` version. To do this, you can use a tool like [ncu](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) or manually update the package version for each repository. Follow the release process in each repository to create a new release.

Additionally, you can create an issue in the desired repo to bump the package version and mark it as blocking release.
